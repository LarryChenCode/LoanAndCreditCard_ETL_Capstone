## Summary
This project involves the following steps:
1. Preprocessing of datasets (Loan Application and Credit Card).
2. Data extraction, transformation, and loading using Python (Pandas, advanced modules like Matplotlib), SQL, and Apache Spark (Spark Core, Spark SQL).
3. Creating a console-based application for data management and visualization.
4. Developing visualizations and analytics using Python libraries.

## Process

### Data Preprocessing
The initial data from various sources required preprocessing to make it suitable for ETL processes. This involved cleaning and transforming the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### Cross-Validation
Cross-validation was performed on the cleaned datasets to determine the best models and methods for data processing and analysis.

### Data Extraction and Transformation
Data was extracted from JSON files using Python and PySpark, transformed according to the requirements, and loaded into an RDBMS (MySQL).

### Console-Based Application
A console-based application was developed to interact with the data, allowing users to query and visualize the data through a text-based interface.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
Python libraries were used to create various visualizations to analyze the data and provide insights. This included plotting transaction counts, customer distributions, and transaction amounts.
